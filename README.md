Update: **After few months of not updating the Indonesia EPG channels, I have finally started to updating most of the channels including the brand new one. See the Indonesia section for more info.**


## Information
Since this is open source, I do not recommend to sell it somewhere else, but you can use it on your playlst for free.
And I do not allowed people to change the epg name to anything else like [this](https://github.com/AqFad2811/epg/pull/17). Since everyone is using it, renaming it will make the epg source from the orignal name empty.

# About
This is a collection of my EPG's. Feel free to use it.

# What to put on XMLTV ID on your playlist?
If you have a playlist to use with this XMLTV EPG data, add `tvg-id="(XMLTV ID HERE)"` before the comma before the channel name. Example:
```
#EXTINF:-1 tvg-id="101",TV1
```

## EPG
Mixxed files of all epg files except for Unifi TV.

## Astro & Sooka
The XMLTV ID is the channel name, for example: `TV1` is the Channel ID for `TV1 HD`.

## Indonesia
The XMLTV id will have the alpha-2 country code `.id` at the end, for example `tvNMovies.id` is the Channel ID for `tvN Movies` or `ROCKAction.id` is the Channel ID for `ROCK Action`.

## unifi TV
The XMLTV ID is the channel number itself, for example: `101` is the Channel ID for `TV1`.
